The figure below illustrates the relationship among drug use, the prevalence of mental health disorders, and suicide rates for the specified isoCode of the country in the code. This relationship figure can be obtained for any country listed in the countries table. To achieve this, I utilized a natural join operation with the suicide table and the havingpeoplewithmentaldisorders table to retrieve the suicide rate, drug use rate, and mental disorders prevalence within a single query. Additionally, I performed another natural join operation with the countries table to obtain the corresponding country name based on the isoCode.

Furthermore, I executed a separate query to calculate the average values of these three attributes and determine the correlation between them, encompassing all countries in the countries list. The correlation coefficient between drug use and mental disorders was found to be 0.4067, indicating a positive moderate correlation. Moreover, the correlation coefficient between drug use and suicide rate was determined to be 0.1907, suggesting a weak positive correlation between drug use and suicide rate. Lastly, the correlation coefficient between mental disorders and suicide rate was found to be -0.0955, which is considered a negligible small value, indicating no significant correlation between mental disorders and suicide rate.
